# Demo Enterprise Modules ora_profile implementation

This repo contains a demonstration of a simple database installation with Enterprise Modules's ora_profile. 
You'll need to provide the Oracle software in modules/software/files.

This demo is based on the generic/centos7 as provided on Vagrant Cloud.

If you like to use Enterprise modules in production, please contact Enterprise Modules at https://www.enterprisemodules.com/


## Starting the node

This example runs the Enterprise modules ora_profile with a masterless puppet environment, it will include the April 2018 patches.


```
$ vagrant up ora-db122
```
